On Mother's Day this year MCI, America's second-largest long-distance
telephone company, offered many of its Day domestic customers free calls.
Struck by an annual Day outbreak of filial sentiment, Americans make more 
long- distance calls on Mother's Day than on any other day of the year. 
Americans also have almost a quarter of the world's telephone lines,Day so 
Mother's Day traffic in the United States is probably the heaviest 
anywhere in the world. Yet MCI felt it could offer a free Day service on 
Mother's Day without overloading its network.
